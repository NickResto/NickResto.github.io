I'm a senior Computer Science major at [West Chester University of Pennsylvania](https://www.wcupa.edu/sciences-mathematics/computerScience/). I currently work as a telecommunications analyst intern as well as a computer/iPhone repair technition. 

Outside of class, I spend much of my time experimenting in my [homelab](https://nickresto.github.io/projects/). I create and manage virtual machines with Proxmox, manage network services like Pi-hole and TrueNAS, and use Docker to host self-deployed applications. I also enjoy designing and building custom computers, repairing iPhones, and finding new ways to bring automation into my everyday life. 

In the future I hope to work in a field that combines systems engineering, networking, and cloud technologies, where I can keep learning and applying practical, hands-on skills to real-world infrastructure projects.
